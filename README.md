# flutter-login-QR-database
This is the source repo of my tutorial on implementing Login feature inside Flutter and allowing the logged in user to scan a QR code and fetch data from the organization's database

I have divided the entire work into different projects. Those will be gradually including the next feature.
1) Flutter login app
2) Scan QR Code after Login
3) Match the scanned QR Code to organization's database and fetch relevant more details of the code.
